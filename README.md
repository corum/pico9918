# PICO9918

A drop-in replacement for a classic TMS9918A VDP using a Raspberry Pi Pico.

The TMS9918A emulation is handled by my [vrEmuTms9918 library](https://github.com/visrealm/vrEmuTms9918) which is included as a submodule here

If you have tested the PICO9918 on any other device, please let me know and I'll happily update this list. :)

### Unsupported devices

So far, there aren't any. 

# F18A compatibility

Work is being done to add F18A compatibility to the PICO9918. The video below was captured directly from the PICO9918 VGA output running various F18A demos on a TI-99/4A.

[![PICO9918 F18A mode preview 1 demo](https://img.visualrealmsoftware.com/youtube/thumb/TabTIPL1xQY)](https://youtu.be/TabTIPL1xQY)

Pre-release firmware for F18A compatibility mode is available in [Releases](https://github.com/visrealm/pico9918/releases/tag/v0.4.1-f18a-preview1).

## Purchasing options

Fully assembled and tested PICO9918 v1.1s are available on my Tindie store:

Also (more convenient for North America)

## Hardware

There are two main variants of the hardware. 

### v1.1 (formerly v1.0 and v0.4)

PICO9918 v1.1 is the single board version which doesn't require a piggy-backed Pi Pico. This is the version you can currently buy pre-assembled from Tindie and ArcadeShopper.

<p align="left"><a href="img/pico9918_v1_0_sm.png"><img src="img/pico9918_v1_0_sm.png" alt="PICO9918 v0.4" width="720px"></a></p>

### v0.3

v0.3 is relatively cheap and easy to build, schematic and gerbers are available. This version makes use of an external Pi Pico module piggy-backed onto the PICO9918 PCB.

<p align="left"><a href="img/pico9918_v0_3_sm.jpg"><img src="img/pico9918_v0_3_sm.jpg" alt="PICO9918 v0.3" width="720px"></a></p>

<p align="left"><a href="img/pico9918_v0_3_sm2.jpg"><img src="img/pico9918_v0_3_sm2.jpg" alt="PICO9918 v0.3" width="720px"></a></p>

### Schematics

Schematics and Gerbers are available in [/pcb](pcb)

## Firmware

If you're not interested in building the firmware yourself, you'll find the latest firmware in the [Releases](https://github.com/visrealm/pico9918/releases).

To install, just hold the 'BOOTSEL' (or 'BOOT') button while plugging the Pico into a PC, then drag the pico9918.uf2 file on to the new USB drive which should have the volume label RPI-RP2. The Pico will restart (and disconnect) automatically.

## Development environment

To set up your development environment for the Raspberry Pi Pico, follow the [Raspberry Pi C/C++ SDK Setup](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/c_sdk.html) instructions. The latest PICO9918 source can be configured and built using the official [Raspberry Pi Pico VSCode plugin](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-vscode).

#### Windows

The build system expects `python3` to be available. If you have installed Python 3 outside of the Microsoft Store, you may need to alias your Python executable.

You can do this from an elevated (Administator) command prompt in your python directory e.g. `C:\Program Files\Python310\` by creating a symlink with the command: `mklink python3.exe python.exe`.

The custom python build tools are used to convert binary data (images) into code. These also require the [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/) library - ([Installation instructions for pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/basic-installation.html))

## Videos

Initial "raw" videos recorded in the moments following the first boot on my TI-99/4A.

These videos are showing the v0.2 hardware with an external Pi Pico providing the required GROMCLK signal to the TI-99. This signal has been added to v0.3. I'm still waiting on v0.3 boards to arrive.
